# Swiggy-EDA-Visualisation
This Swiggy EDA Visualization project aims to provide insights into Swiggy's food delivery data through interactive and informative visualizations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and helping Swiggy optimize its food delivery operations.It is implemented in Python.
This Python-based data visualization project focuses on exploring and visualizing data related to food delivery orders from Swiggy, a popular online food delivery platform. The project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights from the data and uses various data visualization libraries in Python to create interactive and informative visualizations.

Features:

Data Exploration: The project begins by loading and exploring the Swiggy food delivery data. It involves understanding the data structure, checking for missing values, data types, and data distributions. It also includes identifying patterns and trends in the data, such as popular cuisines, most frequent restaurants, average order values, and delivery time analysis.

Data Visualization: The project employs data visualization libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to create meaningful visualizations that help in understanding the data. These visualizations can include bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations, which provide insights into various aspects of food delivery orders, such as order frequency, order values, delivery time, and customer preferences.

Data Insights: The project focuses on extracting actionable insights from the data using visualizations. It aims to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data that can help Swiggy make data-driven decisions, such as optimizing delivery times, identifying popular cuisines, and understanding customer preferences. The visualizations provide a clear and visual representation of the data, making it easy to derive insights and communicate findings.
